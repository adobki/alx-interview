# ___0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix___
This folder contains the actual results of completing the tasks in the project ___[0x07. ROTATE 2D MATRIX](https://intranet.alxswe.com/projects/1220),___ which was a technical interview exercise. The exercise was to rotate a 2D matrix by 90 degrees in clockwise direction so that the order of its values change accordingly.

## Technologies Used
1. Python

## Usage
 * Run the script to view the included examples:
```
$ ./0-rotate_2d_matrix.py
[[1, 2, 3],          [[7, 4, 1],
 [4, 5, 6],    ->     [8, 5, 2],
 [7, 8, 9]]           [9, 6, 3]]

[['one  ', 'two  ', 'three']          [['seven', 'four ', 'one  ']
 ['four ', 'five ', 'six  ']    ->     ['eight', 'five ', 'two  ']
 ['seven', 'eight', 'nine ']]          ['nine ', 'six  ', 'three']]
```

 * Import as a function and pass the matrix as a parameter. Function definition:
```
def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix) -> None
```

## Mandatory Tasks
There is just one task in this project, which is a Python script (*.py) named [0-rotate_2d_matrix.py](0-rotate_2d_matrix.py).

## Advanced Tasks
There is none in this project.
