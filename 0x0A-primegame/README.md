# ___0x0A: Prime Game___
This folder contains my submissions for the project ___[0x0A.Prime Game](https://intranet.alxswe.com/projects/1222),___ which was a technical interview exercise. The exercise was to use the provided game stats `x` and `nums` to calculate the winner of a Prime Game played between two players, named Maria and Ben. The function returns the name of the player that won the most rounds.

## Technologies Used
1. Python

## Usage
 * Import as a function and pass `x` and `nums` as parameters. Function definition:
```
def isWinner(x: int, nums: List[int]) -> str | None
```

 * You can also run the script to view the included examples:
```
$ ./0-prime_game.py
Ben   # print(isWinner(3, [4, 5, 1]))
Ben   # print(isWinner(5, [2, 5, 1, 4, 3]))
None  # print(isWinner(2, [2, 10, 5, 3]))
Maria # print(isWinner(3, [2, 10, 5, 3]))
```

## Mandatory Tasks
There is just one task in this project, which is a Python script (*.py) named [0-prime_game.py](0-prime_game.py).

## Advanced Tasks
There is none in this project.
