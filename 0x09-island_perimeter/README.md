# ___0x09: Island Perimeter___
This folder contains the results of completing the tasks in the project ___[0x09.ISLAND PERIMETER](https://intranet.alxswe.com/projects/1222),___ which was a technical interview exercise. The exercise was to calculate the perimeter of an island represented by a grid, which was a rectangular matrix with 1's and 0's. 0 represented water, while one represented land.

## Technologies Used
1. Python

## Usage
 * Import as a function and pass the grid as a parameter. Function definition:
```
def island_perimeter(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int
```

 * You can also run the script to view the included examples:
```
$ ./0-island_perimeter.py
. . .
12 # grid = [ [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
#             [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
#             [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
#             [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
#             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] ]

20 # grid = [ [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
#             [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
#             [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
#             [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
#             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] ]

14 # grid = [ [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
#             [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
#             [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
#             [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
#             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] ]
```
