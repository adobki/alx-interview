# ___0x06.Star Wars API___
This folder contains the actual results of completing the tasks in the project ___[0x06: STAR WARS API](https://intranet.alxswe.com/projects/1219).___ The project was a technical interview exercise on **_asynchronous JavaScript/ES6_**. The exercise was to make multiple calls to an API (The ALX Star Wars API) and print data from the parsed responses in the same order in which the calls were made.

## Technologies Used
1. Node.js
2. [Request](https://github.com/request/request): A simplified HTTP client. It is designed to be the simplest way possible to make http calls.
3. [The Star Wars API (SWAPI)](https://swapi-api.alx-tools.com): The world's first quantified and programmatically-accessible data source for all the data from the Star Wars canon universe!



## Mandatory Tasks
There is just one task in this project, which is a JavaScript script (*.js) named [0-starwars_characters.js](0-starwars_characters.js), which uses ___callbacks___ recursively, and [1-starwars_characters_promises.js](1-starwars_characters_promises.js), which uses ___promises___ and a while loop instead.

## Advanced Tasks
There is none in this project.
