# ___0x02.Minimum Operations___
This folder contains the actual results of completing the tasks in the project ___0x02: MINIMUM OPERATIONS.___ The project was a technical interview exercise on **_Minimum Operations_**, built around the following scenario:

>In a text file, there is a single character **_H_**. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: **_Copy All_** and **_Paste_**. Given a number **_n_**, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly **_n H_** characters in the file.
> 
> Example:  n = 9
>
> **_H_** => **_Copy All_** => **_Paste_** => **_HH_** => **_Paste_** => **_HHH_** => **_Copy All_** => **_Paste_** => **_HHHHHH_** => **_Paste_** => **_HHHHHHHHH_**
>
> **_Number of operations: 6_**
